=== README ===

Prior to compiling "bam2hints" you need to have BAMTools on your system.

--- If you have Ubuntu or Debian ---

Install bamtools and libbamtools-dev:
   
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bamtools libbamtools-dev

For older versions of Ubuntu than xenial like vivid, make sure the repository "universe" is in your '/etc/apt/sources.list'. 
It should contain a line like:

     deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu vivid main universe


Afterwards, go to the auxprogs/bam2hints directory and run

   make

This produces a bam2hints binary that is located in auxprogs/bam2hints.

--- If for some reason you want to install BAMTools manually ---

Install cmake (or see https://cmake.org)
   sudo apt-get install cmake

Get the latest version of BAMTools from GitHub:
   git clone git://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools.git
or download the zipped version from:
   https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/zipball/master
and unpack:
   unzip pezmaster31-bamtools-v2.5.1-23-g2391b1a.zip -d bamtools
Then follow the instructions under https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/wiki , which are basically:
   cd bamtools
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/path/to/bamtools_install_dir ..
   make
   make install
   

--- Installing bam2hints after manual BAMtools installation ---

For this step, you only need to adjust two lines in the Makefile.

Replace:
   BAMTOOLS_INSTALL_DIR = /usr
By:
   BAMTOOLS_INSTALL_DIR = /your/path/to/bamtools_install_dir

Replace:
   LIBS = -lbamtools -lz
By:
   LIBS = $(BAMTOOLS_INSTALL_DIR)/lib/libbamtools.a -lz

Save and exit the Makefile. Then, running in auxprogs/bam2hints directory the command:
  make
should result in an executable named "bam2hints" that is located in auxprogs/bam2hints.
