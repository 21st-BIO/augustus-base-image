 * @brief class CodonEvoDiscr

 * P(t,omega,kappa,pi) = exp(Q(omega,kappa,pi)*t)
 * for a sample of values for t and omega (dN/dS, selection)
 * and a fixed given value of kappa (transition/transversion ratio)
 * and vector pi (codon usage).
 * Matrices are precomputed and retrieval of P(t,omega) is then a constant time lookup
 * as this is needed very often during estimation of omega for a given tree.
